# LootCouncil EX — Project Source of Truth

> This is the canonical project document. Read it first at the start of every Claude Code session and treat it as authoritative. It supersedes any earlier spec. Intended to live in the repo root as `PROJECT.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`).

---

## 1. Intent

LootCouncil EX is a loot council addon for **World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade Classic (Anniversary realms)**. It replaces RCLootCouncil, whose Classic build is a patch layer bolted onto the retail core and is buggy and clunky as a result.

**North Star:** a fast, clean, TBC-native loot council tool that does the broadcast → respond → vote → award loop without friction, plus a persistent council toolkit (notes, marks, history, gear/profession lookup) that helps the council make decisions.

**Definition of done (v1):** a guild can run a full raid night on this addon — items get councilled and awarded correctly via master loot — and the council can keep synced notes and persistent gear marks across raid nights.

**Non-goals (do not build):** retail/Era/SoD support; DKP/EPGP/GP point systems; PUG support / non-installed-user fallback (stub only); multiple simultaneous loot sessions; cross-guild council sync; auto-trade handoff polish.

---

## 2. Hard constraints

- **TBC Classic Anniversary API only.** Never use retail-only APIs. When unsure of a signature, verify against the current Classic client, don't assume.
- **Native frames only — no AceGUI.** AceGUI is the source of the "ancient/clunky" feel we're escaping. All UI is `CreateFrame` + a shared style layer.
- **Guild-only model.** Assume every raider has the addon installed; the council is all in one guild. The non-installed whisper fallback is stubbed, not implemented.
- **Data realities the design must respect:**
  - *Gear and professions cannot come from Blizzard inspection* (range/faction/throttle limited). Each player's addon **self-reports** its own gear and professions over comms. Non-addon users and offline/out-of-raid players show last-cached data or nothing.
  - *BiS lists, tier-token mappings, and loot tables are shipped static datasets* that must be compiled and maintained per phase. They are reference data, not code.
  - *Out-of-raid council sync is eventually-consistent.* It reconciles only when two council members are online at the same time (no server). It runs over the **guild channel** and assumes a same-guild council.

---

## 3. Architecture — two data planes

Keep these two subsystems mentally and structurally separate.

### Plane A — Live session (ephemeral, ML-authoritative)
The loot voting itself. The **master looter is the single source of truth.** Candidates and council members whisper to the ML; the ML aggregates and rebroadcasts canonical state to RAID. Exists only while a session is open. No peer-to-peer sync — every change funnels through the ML.

**Loot sourcing & handoff (DL-7):** the ML **auto-loots every drop into their own bags** during the raid and councils them in sessions started later (periodically / end of night) — there is no master-loot-from-corpse. The winner receives the item by **trading** it within the BoP 2-hour window; the addon assists the trade and tracks the timer.

### Plane B — Persistent council (durable, multi-writer, replicated)
Player notes, item/gear marks, shared award history, and cached gear/professions. Authored by any council member, replicated among the council over the **GUILD** channel, persisted in SavedVariables, available in or out of raid. No single authority; conflicts resolve **last-write-wins** on a per-record timestamp. Eventually-consistent.

| | Plane A | Plane B |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | Master looter | Every council member |
| Channel | RAID + WHISPER | GUILD + WHISPER |
| Lifetime | One session | Permanent (SavedVariables) |
| Conflict model | ML is authority | Last-write-wins by `mod` timestamp |
| Available out of raid | No | Yes (when peers online) |

---

## 4. Conventions

- **Addon/folder:** `LootCouncilEX`. **Comms prefix:** `LCEX`. **Slash command:** `/lcex`.
- **Libraries:** LibStub + ACE3 (AceAddon, AceEvent, AceComm, AceSerializer, AceConsole, AceDB, AceTimer). **All networking via AceComm — never raw `SendAddonMessage`.**
- **Comms envelope:** every message is one AceSerializer-encoded table `{ v, cmd, sid, ver, ... }`. `v` = `PROTOCOL_VERSION`; drop messages with an unreadable higher major `v`. `cmd` routes through a dispatch table. `sid` identifies the session (nil for Plane B / roster messages). `ver` = the sender's human-facing addon version, stamped on **every** message so peers learn each other's version passively from any traffic (not just the vCheck handshake); the receiver records it silently before dispatch.
- **Plane B record format:** every record carries `mod` (unixtime last modified) and `by` (author char name). **Merge rule:** per key keep the greatest `mod`; ties broken by `by` alphabetically. Immutable datasets (history) merge by union of keys.
- **UI is data-driven:** response buttons, columns, etc. build from the `RESPONSES` table, not hardcoded.
- **Modules are small and single-purpose** per the file layout below.
- **Dev workflow:** symlink the addon folder into the WoW AddOns dir; iterate with `/reload`. This file is the Claude Code context (`PROJECT.md` / `CLAUDE.md`).
- **Frames register for ESC-close** by adding their global name to `UISpecialFrames` (helper in `UI/Widgets.lua`).

## 6. Canonical reference

### 6.1 Plane A messages
Envelope `{ v, cmd, sid, ver, ... }`; `sid` = `"<MLname>-<unixtime>-<counter>"`; `ver` is stamped on every message (see §4).

| cmd | Direction | Channel | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vCheck` | any → raid | RAID | `{}` (ver rides on the envelope) |
| `vReply` | client → asker | WHISPER | `{}` (ver rides on the envelope) |
| `sStart` | ML → raid | RAID | `{ items={[i]={link,quality}}, council={names}, responses, timeout, anon }` |
| `sEnd` | ML → raid | RAID | `{}` |
| `sPing` | ML → raid | RAID | `{}` (liveness heartbeat, ~30s while open; sid on the envelope — DL-6) |
| `cResp` | candidate → ML | WHISPER | `{ item, resp, note, ilvl, gear={link,link} }` |
| `cUpdate` | ML → raid | RAID | `{ item, rows={[name]={resp,reason,note,gear,votes,class}}, status={kind,voted} }` |
| `vVote` | council → ML | WHISPER | `{ item, candidate, vote=±1|0 }` |
| `award` | ML → raid | RAID | `{ item, itemID, itemIndex, winner, resp, boss, instance, ts }` |

Reliability: ML holds the authoritative table; drop inbound `cResp`/`vVote` with a stale `sid` or non-member/non-council sender. Debounce `cUpdate` (~0.2s). Idempotent — re-sends overwrite last value. No ACK in v1. `award` carries enough to build a complete local history record on every present client.

Notes: items live in the ML's bags (no loot slot), so `sStart` items carry only `{link,quality}` — the ML resolves the live `{bag,slot}` locally at trade time. Until Phase-3 voting exists, `award.resp` carries the `STATUS.ANNOUNCED` sentinel; a disenchant award carries `award.resp = STATUS.DISENCHANT` (§6.10).

### 6.2 Plane B messages
Channel GUILD; only council members participate.

| cmd | Direction | Channel | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pReport` | any group member → GUILD | GUILD | `{ gear={slot→link}, profs={name→level}, class, spec, mod }` |
| `pSet` | council → GUILD | GUILD | `{ dataset="notes"|"marks", key, record={text,mod,by} }` |
| `pHello` | council → GUILD | GUILD | `{ digest={ notes={n,maxMod}, marks={n,maxMod}, history={n}, gearCache={n,maxMod}, profCache={n,maxMod} } }` |
| `pSyncReq` | council → peer | WHISPER | `{ dataset, since=<mod|0> }` |
| `pSyncData` | council → peer | WHISPER | `{ dataset, records={key→record} }` |

Sync flow: on login/load broadcast `pHello`; a peer that's behind sends `pSyncReq(since=myMaxMod)`; peer replies `pSyncData` with the delta. Live edits propagate via `pSet`. Accept `pReport` from any group member (so any raider's gear/profs can be viewed); gate `pSet`/`pHello`/`pSync*` to council senders only.

### 6.3 Datasets (Plane B — under `global.guilds[guildKey]` per Feature C / §6.11)
- `notes`: name → `{text, mod, by}`
- `marks`: itemID → `{text, mod, by}`
- `history`: uid → `{player, itemID, itemLink, ts, resp, boss, instance}` (immutable; union merge). uid = `sid..":"..itemIndex` (so `award` carries `itemIndex`). Records also carry `by` (the logging ML) + `mod`=ts for display; union ignores both for merge. Logged locally on every present client from the `award` broadcast (§6.1).
- `gearCache`: name → `{items={slot→link}, class, spec, mod}` (self-reported; `class`/`spec` let the BiS tab auto-resolve a cached player — talent-derived spec, §6.7)
- `profCache`: name → `{profs={name→level}, mod}` (self-reported)
- gbank sets (Feature B, §6.12): `gbankCache` (LWW), `gbankLog` (immutable, union), `gbankNotes` (LWW)

### 6.4 SavedVariables
```lua
LootCouncilEXDB = {
  profile = {
    council            = { byRank=true, rank=1, extra={} },  -- pre-config LOCAL default only; the live roster moves to shared config (§6.9, DL-16 resolves DL-1)
    syncChannel        = "GUILD",
    minQuality         = 4,
    selfReport         = true,
    ui                 = { lootFrame={pos}, votingFrame={pos}, sessionFrame={pos}, playerDetail={pos}, lootBrowser={pos} },
    useWhisperFallback = false,
  },
  global = {
    dbVersion = <int>,                  -- schema version; MigrateDB stamps/upgrades on load (Phase 7)
    guilds = {                          -- Plane B, PER GUILD (config: Phase 9 foundations; notes/marks/history/caches moved here in Feature C / C6 / DL-16)
      [guildKey] = { config={}, notes={}, marks={}, history={}, gearCache={}, profCache={},
                     gbankCache={}, gbankLog={}, gbankNotes={} },  -- gbank sets: Feature B / §6.12
    },
    -- Local (NOT synced) owner-keyed recovery stores so a /reload can't lose ML state (DL-6):
    pendingTrades = { [owner] = { [shortKey] = {owed records} } },  -- owed loot still to be traded out
    session       = { [owner] = {sid, items, council, sessionItems, startedAt} },  -- the open ML session
  },
}
```

### 6.5 Response enum
```lua
RESPONSES = {  -- DEFAULTS; user-configurable (add/remove/rename) is Phase 3
  [1]={id=1,key="BIS",  text="BiS",   color={0.96,0.55,0.73}},
  [2]={id=2,key="MAJOR",text="Major", color={0.20,1.00,0.20}},
  [3]={id=3,key="MINOR",text="Minor", color={1.00,0.96,0.41}},
  [4]={id=4,key="GREED",text="Greed", color={0.70,0.70,0.70}},
  [5]={id=5,key="PASS", text="Pass",  color={0.60,0.20,0.20}},  -- built-in: always present
}
STATUS = { ANNOUNCED=90, TIMEOUT=91, NOADDON=92, DISENCHANT=93 }
```
`PASS` is a built-in response (a candidate must always be able to decline; timeouts resolve to a non-response). The rest are defaults the council may reconfigure once the settings UI lands (DL-8).

### 6.6 Static data shapes
```lua
Loot       = { ["P2"]={ raids={ ["Serpentshrine Cavern"]={ ["Hydross the Unstable"]={itemID,...}, ... }, ["Tempest Keep"]={...} } } }
BiS        = { ["MAGE"]={ ["Fire"]={ ["P2"]={ ["head"]={itemID}, ["neck"]={itemID,altID}, ... } } } }
TierTokens = { [30243]={ name="Helm of the Vanquished Defender", pieces={ ["WARRIOR"]={itemID,...}, ["PRIEST"]={...}, ["DRUID"]={...} } } }  -- pieces[CLASS] is a LIST (spec-variant sets → several pieces)
```

### 6.7 Key TBC APIs (verify signatures)
- **ESC close:** `tinsert(UISpecialFrames, "LCEX_FrameName")`.
- **Loot detect (bags flow):** passively track the ML's own loot via `CHAT_MSG_LOOT` ("You receive loot:" — derive the prefix from `LOOT_ITEM_SELF` for locale) to capture the source boss (`UnitName("target")`) + a looted-at `time()` stamp; plus a bag scan over bags 0-4 via **`C_Container`** (`GetContainerNumSlots` / `GetContainerItemLink` / `GetContainerItemInfo`), falling back to the same-named globals when absent (the globals are nil on Anniversary). Read quality from `GetContainerItemInfo` (cache-independent) for bag items; for a freshly-looted item `GetItemInfo` returns nil on first sight, so resolve quality async via `Item:CreateFromItemLink(link):ContinueOnItemLoad` with an `IsItemDataCached` fast-path and a ~0.5s `AceTimer` timeout. itemID via `link:match("item:(%d+)")`.
- **Award handoff (trade):** the ML trades the item to the winner within the BoP 2-hour window. Do NOT auto-open (`InitiateTrade` is hardware-gated); on `TRADE_SHOW` auto-fill via a single **`UseContainerItem(bag,slot)`** guarded by `TradeFrame:IsShown()` (it drops the item into the first free trade slot; slots 1-6 are tradeable, slot 7 = will-not-be-traded), with a manual-drag fallback and a short bag-locked retry. Confirm delivery on `UI_INFO_MESSAGE == ERR_TRADE_COMPLETE` (snapshot the given items at `TRADE_ACCEPT_UPDATE`, warn on a wrong-winner hand-off) — NOT `TRADE_CLOSED`, which also fires on cancel. Track the 2h window from the looted-at `time()` and warn before it lapses. (`GetMasterLootCandidate`/`GiveMasterLoot` are **not used** — the guild auto-loots to bags, see §3 / DL-7.)
- **Own gear:** `GetInventoryItemLink("player", slotID)`; snapshot on `PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED` (anti-swap).
- **Own professions:** scan `GetNumSkillLines()`/`GetSkillLineInfo(i)` for the two professions + level. (No reliable cross-player profession inspect — self-report only.)
- **Own spec:** on Anniversary `GetTalentTabInfo(tab)` returns `(id, name, description, icon, pointsSpent, fileName)` — take the tab with the most `pointsSpent` (the **5th** return; the 3rd is the description `""`) and use its `name` (2nd) as the spec. Self-reported in `pReport` like gear/profs. (Verified against BigWigs/Cell/Details/NovaInstanceTracker. The single-arg form reads the active tabs; `GetActiveTalentGroup` is not needed.)
- **Equipped ilvl:** `GetAverageItemLevel` unreliable in Classic; show the competing-slot item from the snapshot instead.
- **Comms:** `RegisterComm("LCEX", handler)`; `SendCommMessage("LCEX", msg, "RAID"|"GUILD"|"WHISPER", target)`. GUILD reaches all online guildies (the out-of-raid path).
- **Guild bank (Feature B — all net-new, verify each):** contents/logs readable **only while the frame is open**. `GetNumGuildBankTabs`, `GetGuildBankTabInfo(tab)`, `QueryGuildBankTab(tab)` (throttled — one per round-trip, answered by `GUILDBANKBAGSLOTS_CHANGED`), `GetGuildBankItemLink(tab,slot)`/`GetGuildBankItemInfo(tab,slot)`, `GetGuildBankMoney`. Logs: `GetNumGuildBankTransactions(tab)`/`GetGuildBankTransaction(tab,i)` (+ money log) report **elapsed** time, not absolute. Events: `GUILDBANKFRAME_OPENED`/`_CLOSED`, `GUILDBANKBAGSLOTS_CHANGED`, `GUILDBANK_UPDATE_MONEY`.

### 6.8 Gear-issue detection (Feature G)
Adopts the CLA "gear issues" model (`docs/CLA_gear_issues_findings.md`) as a **viewer-side** analysis over the gear links already in `gearCache` (§6.3) — **no comms or protocol change** (DL-13). Rules ship as static data (`Data/GearRules.lua`); `Core/GearIssues.lua` is the pure, headless-tested evaluator; results surface in the Roster → Gear sub-tab (per-item tags) and a **Gear Check** overview *within* the Roster tab (the Players module renamed to **Roster** — everyone + issue counts, the pre-raid slacker scan). **Display-only in v1** (no auto-whisper). v1 ships the **core three** checks (enchant / empty-socket / gem-quality); boss-conditional + meta-gem are deferred (see below).

**Item-string parse.** Split the itemString on `:` — the field after `itemID` = enchantID (0 = none); the next four fields = socketed gem itemIDs (0 = empty). This is a new full-string splitter (existing parsers grab only the itemID).

**Socket count** comes from `GetItemStats(link)` keys `EMPTY_SOCKET_RED|YELLOW|BLUE|META|PRISMATIC` (the item's *inherent* sockets). Empty sockets = inherent sockets − filled gem fields. **Verify on the live Anniversary client (X3):** if `GetItemStats` sockets prove unreliable, fall back to a tooltip scan (localized "Socket" lines) or a reporter-side socket count added to `pReport`/`gearCache` — the *only* variant that would touch comms.

**Rule tables — `Data/GearRules.lua`** (CLA §4, WCL slot indices remapped to `INVSLOT_*` per CLA §3):
```lua
GearRules = {
  minGemQuality = 3,                                   -- rare; filled gem below this = flagged (meta exempt)
  enchantable   = { [INVSLOT_HEAD]=true, ... },        -- slots that SHOULD carry an enchant
  enchantAllow  = { [INVSLOT_HEAD]={ [enchID]=true }, ... },  -- per-slot acceptable enchants (allowlist; CLA §6 inversion — fails safe)
  enchantLabel  = { [enchID]="+10 Critical Strike", ... },    -- names for flagged enchants (GetItemInfo can't resolve enchant names)
  excludeItems  = { [15138]=true, ... },               -- never flag (fishing poles, off-set, un-enchantable BiS) — CLA §4c
}
```

**Evaluation pipeline** — per equipped item, emit one tag per failure (CLA §5):
1. In `excludeItems`? → skip all checks.
2. Slot in `enchantable` and enchantID == 0 → `[no enchant]`.
3. enchantID present and **not** in `enchantAllow[slot]` → `[bad enchant]` (label from `enchantLabel`, else "non-BiS enchant"). Unknown enchant → flagged for review (fail-safe).
4. Empty socket (inherent > filled) → `[no gem used]` (×N).
5. Filled non-meta gem below `minGemQuality` (quality via `GetItemInfo` on the gem itemID) → `[bad gem]`.

**Deferred to a fast-follow (DL-13):** the boss-conditional "useless item" family (undead / demon / PvP-trinket / engineering — needs per-encounter flag tables + item→condition maps), meta-gem activation, and true socket-**color** matching. v1 does enchant presence/allowlist + empty-socket + gem-quality only.

**Display.** Per-item tags render in Roster → Gear (danger tone = missing, warning tone = suboptimal). The **Gear Check** view (within the Roster tab) lists every present/cached player with an issue count and badges the roster picker per player; empty = "no issues". Own character evaluates live equipped gear; others evaluate from `gearCache` with the existing "cached Nm ago" freshness. Names come from `enchantLabel` (enchants) / `GetItemInfo` (gems) — arbitrary good-enchant names via tooltip scan are deferred.

### 6.9 Guild identity + shared config (foundations for Features V / C / B)
Features V, C, and B need a **guild-scoped, officer-authored config** shared across the council. Two new primitives:

**Guild identity — `Core/Guild.lua`.** `LCEX:GuildKey()` = the current guild's identity from `GetGuildInfo("player")` (name, realm-qualified — **verify the API on the live client, X3**), recomputed on `PLAYER_GUILD_UPDATE`/`GUILD_ROSTER_UPDATE` and cached; nil when guildless (config editing then falls to the C4 escape hatch). An officer in >1 guild defaults to the current character's guild (B2). Same file exposes `LCEX:PresentRoster()` → `{ {name, class}, ... }` for the current raid/party (lifting the `raid1..raidN` + `UnitName`/`UnitClass` loop from `Display.lua:106-111`) — used by Feature V's row seeding and the present-council tally.

**Shared config — `Core/council/Config.lua`**, a Plane-B **LWW dataset** (rides the §6.2 `RegisterDataset` / `pHello` / `pSync*` machinery) keyed by `guildKey`, **one officer-authored record per guild**, gated to council senders like `pSet`:
```lua
config[guildKey] = {
  rank          = 1,                 -- officer/council rank cutoff (moves here from profile.council → resolves DL-1)  [C]
  extra         = {},                -- manual council adds                                                          [C]
  responses     = { ...RESPONSES },  -- the guild's response set (resolves DL-8)                                      [C]
  anonVoting    = false,             -- hide who-voted (V7)                                                          [V]
  disenchanters = { name, ... },     -- ordered; top = highest rank (V5)                                             [V]
  visibility    = { gbankLog=false, gbankNotes=false, lootWindow=false, ... },  -- per-guild view rules (B5, C7)     [C/B]
  mod, by,
}
```
Populated incrementally: **Feature V** writes/reads `anonVoting` + `disenchanters`; **Feature C** moves `rank`/`extra`/`responses` here (resolving DL-1/DL-8) and layers the inherit-on-first-load prompt (C1/C5); **Feature B** adds `visibility`. A client with no local `config[guildKey]` pulls it via the normal sync flow; C adds the "inherit `<Guild>` config from `<Player>`? Y/N" gate before adopting. Escape hatch (C4): editable when you're GM (rank 0), or no record exists yet, or you're solo/guildless. **Re-keying the *other* datasets (notes/marks/history/caches, and B's gbank) under `guildKey` + hide-on-leave is Feature C's job (C6)** — unreleased, so no migration.

### 6.10 Live-session readiness + roster rows (Feature V)
Reworks the live session so every present raider appears, plus an award-readiness border, a vote tally, anonymous voting, and a disenchant award type. Council-facing only (non-council see just the poll — C7).

**Roster rows (V1).** The row list is the **union (deduped by normalized name) of two sets** (R1): (1) the **kill set** — the raid roster snapshotted at *loot time* onto each captured item (attach in `OnChatMsgLoot`, `Award.lua:177-189`, carried through `BuildCouncilableList` → `sessionItems`/staging beside `boss/instance/lootedAt`; manual-adds fall back to the `StartSession` roster) — the practical proxy for "present at the kill" (no kill event; DL-7 auto-loot); and (2) the **current raid** at vote time (`PresentRoster()`), so latecomers who missed the kill still appear. "More data is better." Per-item **eligible** = in the kill set AND `ClassCanUse(link, class)`. `session.rows[i]` is **pre-seeded** at `StartSession` from the union (no longer starts empty):
```lua
rows[i][name] = { name, class, resp, reason, votes=0, note, gear }
-- reason (non-responders):  "pending"    eligible, no response yet    → MIGHT ROLL
--                           "cantuse"    in kill set, unusable        → Ineligible (can't use)
--                           "missedkill" in current raid, not @ kill  → Ineligible (missed kill)
--                           "left"       was @ kill, no longer present
```
An incoming `cResp` merges into the seeded row via the existing `prev = rows[key]` path (`Session.lua:314`), setting `resp` and clearing `reason` — **the seed's `class`/`reason` must survive the overwrite** (`Session.lua:315-321` preserves only `votes` today). **Accumulate/union over the session (R5):** a row is **never dropped**; on leave/rejoin its `reason` re-marks **subtly**.

**Eligibility is a soft, fail-open gate (R2).** Ineligible rows (`cantuse` / `missedkill`) are flagged and are not a default/auto award target, but **the ML can always override and award anyone** — a bugged or stale snapshot must **never block a legitimate award**. The gate warns; it does not prevent. (A real `ENCOUNTER_END`/`UNIT_DIED` kill hook to tighten the kill set is a possible later refinement — DL-15.)

**Display (V1).** Three tiers — **ROLLED > MIGHT ROLL > NOT ROLLING** (R3): rollers (non-PASS responses) on top, sorted by response/votes; **might-roll** (`pending`) directly below them; then **not-rolling** (passed + `cantuse` + `missedkill` + `left`) at the bottom, dimmed (RCLC). The two ineligible reasons share one dimmed style, labeled distinctly — "Ineligible (missed kill)" / "Ineligible (can't use)". The item rail orders **chronologically, oldest loot first** (`lootedAt`; manual-adds last).

**Readiness border (V3/V4).** The **ML computes a per-item `status` and broadcasts it** (new `cUpdate.status`) so every client draws the same **rail-row** border (header icon unchanged — V4), applied receiver-side like `awarded` (the `award`-flow template) and painted in `FillLootRailRow` (`LootWindow.lua:208-243`). Present-eligible = the eligible rows (in the kill set, can use it, still present — the `pending` + rolled rows; excludes `cantuse`/`missedkill`/`left`, R4); "wants it" = a non-PASS response; "voted" = ≥1 non-zero vote (no abstain — V2):

| status.kind | color | condition |
|---|---|---|
| `awarded` | dark green | `awarded[i]` set |
| `de` | blue | nobody wants it **and** all present-eligible have responded → ready to disenchant |
| `ready` | light green | someone wants it **and** (all present council have voted **or** all responded with exactly one roller) |
| `voting` | gold | someone wants it, all present-eligible responded, not yet `ready` |
| `waiting` | grey | otherwise (responses still outstanding) |

Precedence `awarded > ready > de > voting > waiting` (Vd3); `ready`/`de` are mutually exclusive by construction. `Core/session/Readiness.lua` is the pure, headless-tested calculator. New theme colors: dark-green, light-green, status-blue, neutral-grey (gold = `accent`) in `Theme.lua` (Vd2).

**Vote tally (V6).** `status.voted = { n, of }` — `of` = present-council count, `n` = how many have voted on this item — renders "X / Y voted" in the loot window (existing text tones). Unless anonymous, `status` also carries voter names for a who-voted list. RCLC-like.

**Anonymous voting (V7).** `config.anonVoting` is snapshotted into the session and carried on `sStart` (`anon`) so all clients agree for the session's lifetime; when on, the ML omits voter names from `cUpdate` (the count still shows). Default off (Vd6).

**Disenchant award type (V5).** New `STATUS.DISENCHANT = 93` (§6.5). A **D/E button** per item (ML) picks the highest-ranked `config.disenchanters` entry who is **present and eligible to receive**, confirms "Send to `<name>` for d/e?" → on Yes, `AwardItem(i, name)` with `resp = STATUS.DISENCHANT`. Award messaging becomes "`<item>` was awarded to `<player>` for `<reason>`" (reason = the winner's response text, or **D/E**). Falls back to a manual target pick if no disenchanter is set/present (Vd7).

### 6.11 Council access control + guild scoping (Feature C)
Builds on the shared config (§6.9). Three parts:

**Council sourced from shared config (C1/C2 — resolves DL-1).** `ResolveCouncil` (`Session.lua:35-54`) reads `config.rank`/`config.extra` (the per-guild shared record) instead of `profile.council` — the roster is now **officer-authored and replicated**, so every client resolves the same council. "Officer rank" = that `rank` cutoff; `AmCouncil()`/`IsCouncil()` stay the same predicates over the resolved set (C2). `profile.council` is kept only as the pre-config local default (escape hatch).

**Gating — `Core/Access.lua`** (role + visibility predicates, headless-tested; reads `AmCouncil()` + `config.visibility`):
- **Officer settings (C3):** the Session Config module is added to the council rail only when `AmCouncil()` (the `CouncilWindow.lua` module loop) — hidden from non-council. Personal settings (`ConfigWindow`) stay visible to everyone (Cd2).
- **Loot/voting window (C7):** non-council can't open the loot window unless `config.visibility.lootWindow` — by default raiders see only the **poll** + the chat `award` announcements; opt-in per guild for transparency.
- **Greyed controls (Cd3):** a new disabled state on `CreateCheckbox`/`CreateSliderV2` (`faint` tone + `EnableMouse(false)`) — Widgets has none today.

**Guild scoping + hide-on-leave (C6).** Every replicated dataset (`config` from Phase 9, plus `notes`/`marks`/`history`/`gearCache`/`profCache`, and Feature B's gbank sets) lives under a **per-guild namespace `db.global.guilds[guildKey]`** — the `RegisterDataset` store accessors (`Sync.lua`) return `db.global.guilds[guildKey][name]`. Switching guild (or leaving → `guildKey` nil) swaps the active view, so **an old guild's data is no longer addressed** — hidden without deletion. The sync/council gate is already per-`guildKey` (a peer in another guild fails `SyncSenderOk`). Local owner-keyed recovery stores (`pendingTrades`/`session`) stay account-global (live ML state, not council data). **Unreleased ⇒ no migration.**

**Inherit on first load (C1/C5, escape hatch C4).** On login with no local `config` for the current `guildKey`, the normal `pHello`/`pSyncReq` pull fetches a peer's; before adopting, a themed popup asks **"Inherit `<Guild>` loot-council settings from `<Player>`? Y/N"** (`<Player>` = the highest-ranked officer source). "No" keeps local defaults and stops asking this session. **Escape hatch (C4):** config is directly editable — no inherit — when you're **GM (rank 0)**, **no config exists yet** anywhere, or you're **solo/guildless**.

### 6.12 Guild Bank (Feature B)
A new council module (`UI/council/GbankModule.lua`, key `gbank`, order 50) over a Plane-B scanner/cache (`Core/council/Gbank.lua`). All data is **guild-scoped** (`db.global.guilds[guildKey]`, §6.11) and replicated. **Every guild-bank API is net-new — verify on the live client (X3, §6.7).**

**Scan on open (B6).** On `GUILDBANKFRAME_OPENED`, auto-query **every viewable tab** in sequence (`QueryGuildBankTab` is throttled — one per round-trip, answered by `GUILDBANKBAGSLOTS_CHANGED`; space with AceTimer). Cache per tab: name/icon (`GetGuildBankTabInfo`) + each slot's `{link, count}` (`GetGuildBankItemLink`/`GetGuildBankItemInfo`); cache gold (`GetGuildBankMoney`) and tab count. Un-scanned tabs render "not cached" (Bd5). Everything outside an open frame renders from cache.

**Append-only ledger (B3).** Transaction logs are ephemeral, indexed, ID-less, and report **elapsed** time (`GetGuildBankTransaction` → type/name/itemLink/count/tabs + years/months/days/hours-ago; money via `GetGuildBankMoneyTransaction`). On each open: read the logs, convert **elapsed → absolute** (`capturedAt − elapsed`), synthesize a **content-hash uid** (`type+name+itemLink+count+tabs+absoluteHour`), and **append new uids to a union ledger**, deduping against stored entries. *Limitation:* elapsed time is hour-granular, so two identical transactions by the same player in the same hour collapse to one uid — an API constraint, accepted.

**Grouping (B4).** For display, consecutive ledger entries by the **same player + same action** within **5 minutes** collapse into one group: identical items show one icon + **"xN"** (a new count overlay on `CreateItemIcon`, Bd4), distinct items sit side by side under a header summary ("7 items / 187g"). A group's ID = its earliest entry's uid (stable for annotations).

**Annotations (B5/B7).** Council/officers attach a note to a **group** — a new **LWW dataset** keyed by the group's lead uid (`{text, mod, by}`), like `notes`/`marks`. v1 ships the annotation feature itself; the **auto close-prompt + chat reminder are deferred** (B7), as is the whole **withdrawal-request flow** (B5).

**Datasets (Plane B, guild-scoped):**
- `gbankCache`: `tab → {name, icon, slots={slot→{link,count}}, mod, by}` + a `"money"` key `{gold, mod, by}` (LWW — latest scan wins).
- `gbankLog`: `uid → {kind, player, itemLink, count, tabs, ts}` (immutable; **union** merge, like `history`).
- `gbankNotes`: `groupUid → {text, mod, by}` (LWW).

**Replication (B1).** All three ride the existing sync engine, guild-scoped. An officer's withdrawal enters their `gbankLog` on their next scan and propagates via `pSet`/`pSync` — "real-time" bounded by when the capturing officer's client syncs. *(A chat print on receiving a gold-withdrawal / annotation sync is deferred — todo.md.)*

**Visibility (B5).** `config.visibility` (§6.9) gates the sensitive views: **contents + gold visible to all guild members by default**; **logs / annotations hidden from non-council by default**, each toggle per guild.

**UI (B8 / Bd1-3 / Bd6).** A **hero gold card** on top (a `Surface("raised")` card with the cached total in coin icons, built inline in the poll-card style, with "cached Nm ago" freshness — Bd2/Bd3), a **tab selector** for the bank tabs, and **Contents** (item grid) / **Log** (grouped, annotatable, money+item unified, newest-first — Bd6) sub-tabs.

## 7. Build map

Each phase has a hard scope and an exit criterion. Do not build ahead into a later phase. Phases 1–3 produce a working voting addon (the MVP); 4–7 add the council toolkit.

**Phase 1 — Skeleton + comms proof.** `Const`, `Init`, `Comms`, `Roster` + libs.
*Exit:* two clients in a raid, `/lcex` works, `vCheck` round-trips and each prints the other's name + version. No UI. No Lua errors on load.

**Phase 2 — Loot engine (headless).** `session/Session.lua` (state machine), `session/Award.lua` (bags/loot detection, session start, award = assist-trade). Items are sourced from the ML's bags (auto-looted during the raid), not a corpse.
*Exit:* the ML's looted epics are tracked → `/lcex start` broadcasts `sStart` → `/lcex award <n> <name>` records the winner + broadcasts `award` → opening a trade with the winner auto-fills the item (or prompts a manual drag) → the 2h trade timer warns before it lapses. Driven/verified through chat output, `/lcex test`, and a willing trade partner — no live boss required, still no real UI.

**Phase 3 — Session UI → MVP.** `UI/Widgets.lua`, `SessionFrame`, `LootFrame`, `VotingFrame`, wired via `session/Candidate.lua` + `session/Council.lua`.
*Exit:* full live loop between 2+ clients — item drops → candidates respond in a frame → council sees the table and votes → ML awards → item assigned. **This is a usable loot council addon.**

**Phase 4 — Sync engine proof.** `council/Sync.lua` (GUILD transport, `pHello` digest, `pSyncReq`/`pSyncData` deltas, LWW merge) + dataset scaffolding.
*Exit:* two council clients reconcile a *dummy* dataset across offline/online — write on A while B is offline, B catches up on login. Proven before any feature rides on it.

**Phase 5 — Council datasets.** `council/Notes.lua`, `Marks.lua`, `History.lua`, `SelfReport.lua`.
*Exit:* notes, marks, award history, and gear/profession self-reports all sync between council members; awards log automatically from `award`.

**Phase 6 — Viewers + data scaffolding.** `Data/*` (stub samples), `UI/PlayerDetail.lua` (tabbed), `UI/LootBrowser.lua` (phase tabs, boss-sorted, editable marks), tier-token reference.
*Exit:* clicking a player opens the detail panel (gear/history/professions/BiS/notes); loot browser renders by phase/boss with editable persistent marks.

**Phase 7 — Content + polish.** Populate real `Data/*` tables; edge cases (ML disconnect mid-session, stale-cache indicators, roster changes); deferred niceties.
*Exit:* production-ready for a full raid night across multiple weeks.

### Post-v1 feature suite (phases 8–11)
Phases 8–11 extend **past** the original v1 definition of done — the four features scoped in `todo.md` (probe-for-detail): gear issues, voting-readiness, council access control, guild bank. Specced incrementally; build order **8 → 9 → 10 → 11** (G → V → C → B) by dependency + risk. A small **shared-foundations** step (guild identity/`guildKey`, X4; shared-config, X5) leads **Phase 9** (Feature V is the first consumer of shared config) and is reused by Phases 10–11. *(Phases 9–11 are specced as each is reached; see `todo.md` for their locked decisions.)*

**Phase 8 — Gear issues (Feature G).** `Core/GearIssues.lua` (pure detection over `gearCache` links + `GetItemStats` sockets), `Data/GearRules.lua` (CLA-derived rule tables); **rename the Players module → Roster**, add per-item tags in Roster → Gear, gear-issue badges on the roster picker, and a **Gear Check** overview view within it. Core three checks only (enchant allowlist + empty socket + gem quality); viewer-side, no comms change (DL-13).
*Exit:* the Gear Check view lists every raider's enchant/gem problems pre-raid; a test character wearing a missing-enchant + empty-socket + green-gem item surfaces exactly `[no enchant]` `[no gem used]` `[bad gem]`; `/lcex selftest` covers the detection logic (headless, fixed links → expected tags) + the `GetItemStats` socket contract (in-game). Boss-conditional + meta-gem checks are explicitly out of this phase.

**Phase 9 — Foundations + voting readiness (Feature V).** *Foundations first:* `Core/Guild.lua` (`GuildKey` + `PresentRoster`), `Core/council/Config.lua` (shared officer-config LWW dataset, §6.9). *Then Feature V:* pre-seed `session.rows` from the present-at-loot roster with per-item eligibility; `Core/session/Readiness.lua` (pure status calc); rail-row readiness borders via a broadcast `cUpdate.status`; the "X/Y voted" tally; anonymous voting (snapshotted onto `sStart.anon`); the D/E award type (`STATUS.DISENCHANT`, target from `config.disenchanters`). New theme colors (Vd2).
*Exit:* in a 2+ client session every present raider shows a row (rollers on top; pass/can't-use/left dimmed at the bottom); the rail is oldest-loot-first; an item nobody wants borders **blue** and the D/E button trades it to the configured disenchanter ("awarded … for D/E"); an item where all present council voted borders **light-green**; the tally reads "X/Y voted"; toggling anonymous hides voter names but not the count; `config` replicates between two officers. `/lcex selftest` covers the readiness cascade (headless) + `GuildKey`/`PresentRoster`/`config` round-trip.

**Phase 10 — Council access control + guild scoping (Feature C).** `Core/Access.lua` (role/visibility predicates); source council from `config` (`ResolveCouncil`); hide the Session Config module + the loot window from non-council (`CouncilWindow`/`LootWindow`, greyed-control helper in `Widgets`); move all Plane-B datasets under `db.global.guilds[guildKey]` (`Sync.lua`/`Init.lua`); the inherit-on-first-load prompt + escape hatch.
*Exit:* a non-council raider sees the poll + award chat but neither the Session Config module nor the loot window (unless the guild opts in); two officers editing the roster/rank converge via shared config; a fresh install in an established guild is offered "inherit `<Guild>` config from `<Player>`? Y/N" and adopts on Yes; leaving the guild hides that guild's notes/marks/history/caches. `/lcex selftest` covers the access predicates (headless) + a guild-scoped dataset round-trip.

**Phase 11 — Guild Bank (Feature B).** `Core/council/Gbank.lua` (scan-on-open, append-only ledger, guild-scoped `gbankCache`/`gbankLog`/`gbankNotes`) + `UI/council/GbankModule.lua` (hero gold card, tab selector, Contents/Log sub-tabs, "xN" icon overlay). Council-only annotations; configurable visibility. Withdrawal-request flow + auto note-prompt deferred.
*Exit:* opening the guild bank caches all tabs + gold + logs; the module shows the hero gold total, per-tab contents, and a grouped newest-first log; an officer annotates a withdrawal group and a second officer sees both the note and the withdrawal replicate; non-council see contents+gold but not logs/annotations (unless the guild opts in). `/lcex selftest` covers the ledger dedup/grouping (headless) + the guild-bank API contract (in-game).

---

## 8. Decision log / open questions

- **DL-1 (RESOLVED, Phase 10 — Feature C):** the council roster is **one** list, now sourced from the officer-authored, replicated shared `config` (`byRank`/`rank`/`extra`), so every client resolves the same council (`CouncilConfig`/`SetCouncilConfig`; `ResolveCouncil` reads it). `profile.council` remains only as the pre-config local default + escape hatch (C4). No split between vote/sync membership — one roster for v1 as originally intended, just no longer per-client-local.
- **DL-2 (out of scope v1):** cross-guild council sync via custom channel — fragile; deferred.
- **DL-3 (accepted v1):** no ACK on Plane A; last-write-wins + re-click. Revisit only if delivery gaps appear in practice.
- **DL-4 (accepted, no alternative):** gear/professions are self-reported; out-of-raid / non-addon users show cached or none.
- **DL-5 (open, content task):** static datasets must be maintained each phase; consider a build-time import from a community dataset instead of hand-editing.
- **DL-6 (closed, Phase 7):** ML disconnect mid-session recovery is defined. The ML heartbeats `sPing` (~30s) while a session is open; a candidate that hears nothing for 95s closes the stale view (no one is stuck). The open ML session and any owed trades are mirrored to `global.session`/`global.pendingTrades` (owner-keyed, local) and restored on login — the ML is offered `/lcex resume` (re-broadcasts `sStart` with the same sid) or `/lcex end` to discard.
- **DL-7 (accepted v1):** loot flow is auto-loot-to-ML-bags + later sessions + handoff by **trade** within the BoP 2h window. This supersedes the original master-loot-from-corpse assumption; `GetMasterLootCandidate`/`GiveMasterLoot` are not used.
- **DL-8 (open, Phase 3):** response buttons are user-configurable (add/remove/rename); only the DEFAULT set (BiS/Major/Minor/Greed + built-in Pass) exists until the settings UI lands. The set used in a session will need to be consistent across participants (likely carried in `sStart` or a synced config).
- **DL-9 (done, Phase 7):** the 2h trade window prefers the looted-at `time()` anchor; for items already in bags before login it now reads the *real* remaining time by scanning the item tooltip for the localized `BIND_TRADE_TIME_REMAINING` line (RCLC's technique — `GetContainerItemTradeTimeRemaining` is RCLC's own method, not a Blizzard global) and sets `expireAt = now + remaining`. The scan is guarded: if the string/line is absent it falls back to the prior "no timer" behavior, so it only ever adds a countdown.
- **DL-10 (Phase 4, partially mitigated):** the §6.2 `{n, maxMod}` digest + delta can miss records. *Implemented* (`council/Sync.lua`): pull is **directional** — request only when the peer's `maxMod` or `n` exceeds ours (a higher count → full pull, `since=0`); a peer that's *ahead* **hellos back** (WHISPER) so a freshly-logged-in client is reached by those already online. *Remaining gap:* two peers with the **same count and same `maxMod` but disjoint keys** (e.g. each wrote one record in the same second while apart) can't be told apart by this digest. Acceptable for v1 (rare, second-granularity); closing it needs a content-hash digest or a periodic `since=0` resync.
- **DL-12 (accepted, 2026-07-03 — the four-frame UI):** the UI is four holistic windows —
  **poll** (raider response cards: class-usability filtered via token lines + a TBC proficiency
  matrix, max 3 visible, queue advances into the top slot, per-card notes, optional response
  deadline carried in `sStart` as a duration), **loot** (two-pane in-raid interface: staging-only
  editable item list that freezes at Start — the `uid = sid:index` invariant holds by
  construction; candidate table + votes + award per item), **council** (resizable left-rail
  dashboard over a module registry: Browser / Players / History / Session Config, expandable),
  and **config** (schema-driven user settings). Style: flat-dark gradient surfaces, gold accent
  (patterned on iddqd/Cell, TBC-safe per Gargul). Minimap: LDB + LibDBIcon, left=loot,
  right=council, ctrl=config. **Mid-session item mutation was explicitly rejected** (staging
  only): every wire/index contract predating the redesign is unchanged. Reopening the poll
  (`/lcex respond`) intentionally shows ALL items again — re-clicking is the DL-3 re-respond
  mechanism.
- **DL-11 (accepted, Phase 3):** Plane-A session authority is bound to the **`sStart` sender**, per `sid` — candidates/council record the ML as whoever opened the session and accept subsequent `cUpdate`/`sEnd`/`award` only from that same sender carrying that `sid`. The WoW master-looter API is **not** the authority source: under DL-7 the group need not be using master loot during a council session, so `GetRaidRosterInfo`-derived ML (RCLC's model) doesn't apply here. The trusted guild model (§2) makes initial trust of the `sStart` sender acceptable for v1; `sid` stays an identifier, not a credential. On the ML's own client the session ML is simply whoever runs `/lcex start` (it broadcasts `sStart`); `PlayerIsML` governs only passive loot-tracking, a separate concern.
- **DL-13 (accepted, 2026-07-04 — Feature G gear issues):** enchant/gem issue detection is **viewer-side** over the links already in `gearCache` + `GetItemStats` sockets — **no comms/protocol change**. The one exception: if `GetItemStats` sockets prove unreliable on Anniversary (verify via selftest, X3), a reporter-side socket count is added to `pReport`/`gearCache`. Rules ship as **static `Data/GearRules.lua`** (CLA-derived: per-slot enchant **allowlist** that fails safe on unknown enchants, gem-min-quality = rare, excluded-gear whitelist), **not** guild-editable in v1. The boss-conditional "useless item" (undead/demon/PvP/engi) + meta-gem-activation checks, and true socket-color matching, are **deferred to a fast-follow**. Model: `docs/CLA_gear_issues_findings.md`; canonical spec §6.8.
- **DL-14 (accepted, 2026-07-04 — foundations: guild identity + shared config):** `Core/Guild.lua` derives a `guildKey` from `GetGuildInfo` (realm-qualified; verify live, X3) plus a `PresentRoster` helper. `Core/council/Config.lua` is a Plane-B **LWW dataset keyed by `guildKey`** (one officer-authored record per guild) riding the existing sync engine — the home for the response set (resolves **DL-8**) and the council rank/extra roster (resolves **DL-1** once Feature C moves them in), plus anon/disenchanters/visibility. Re-keying the other datasets under `guildKey` + hide-on-leave is Feature C (C6); unreleased ⇒ no migration. §6.9.
- **DL-15 (accepted, 2026-07-04 — Feature V voting readiness):** `session.rows` is pre-seeded one row per present raider (`PresentRoster` + `ClassCanUse`); non-rollers dim to the bottom (RCLC); the rail sorts oldest-loot-first. The ML computes a per-item **status** (awarded/de/ready/voting/waiting) and broadcasts it on `cUpdate` so all clients draw the same **rail-row** border (header unchanged). Adds a vote tally (`status.voted={n,of}`), anonymous voting (snapshotted onto `sStart.anon`, default off), and a **D/E award type** (`STATUS.DISENCHANT=93`; target = highest-ranked present+eligible `config.disenchanters`; reason renders "D/E"). **Row-set (resolved 2026-07-04, R1–R5):** the list is the union (deduped) of the **kill set** (raid snapshotted at loot time — the proxy for the kill; manual-adds → `StartSession` roster) and the **current raid** (latecomers → `missedkill`); per-item eligible = in-kill-set ∧ `ClassCanUse`. Three display tiers **ROLLED > MIGHT ROLL (`pending`) > NOT ROLLING** (dimmed). Eligibility is a **soft, fail-open gate** — it flags/warns but the ML can always award anyone; a bad snapshot must never block a legitimate award. Accumulate/union over the session (never drop a row; re-mark leave/rejoin subtly). §6.10.
- **DL-16 (accepted, 2026-07-04 — Feature C access control + guild scoping):** the council roster moves from local `profile.council` into the shared `config` record (§6.9), officer-authored and replicated — **resolves DL-1** (one roster, now consistent guild-wide). `Core/Access.lua` gates the Session Config module and the loot window behind `AmCouncil()` + `config.visibility` (raiders see only the poll + award chat by default; per-guild opt-in). All Plane-B datasets are namespaced under `db.global.guilds[guildKey]`, so leaving a guild hides its data with no deletion (hide-on-leave, C6); local recovery stores stay account-global. First-load inherit prompt ("inherit `<Guild>` from `<Player>`? Y/N") with a GM / no-config / solo escape hatch (C4). Unreleased ⇒ no migration. §6.11.
- **DL-17 (accepted, 2026-07-04 — Feature B guild bank):** a new `gbank` council module over a Plane-B scanner (`Core/council/Gbank.lua`). Scan all viewable tabs on `GUILDBANKFRAME_OPENED` (throttled queries); cache contents+gold (LWW `gbankCache`) and an **append-only union ledger** (`gbankLog`) built by converting the logs' **elapsed** time to absolute + a content-hash uid (dedup is hour-granular — an API limitation, accepted). Rapid same-player+action entries **group** (5-min window, "xN" icon overlay); **council-only annotations** attach to a group (LWW `gbankNotes`). All guild-scoped (§6.11) + replicated (real-time bounded by the capturing officer's sync). `config.visibility` hides logs/annotations from non-council by default (contents+gold public). **Deferred:** withdrawal-request flow, auto close-prompt/chat reminder, sync-notification chat prints. Guild-bank APIs verify on the live client (X3). §6.12.

## 9. Glossary
- **ML** — master looter; the loot authority for a session (Plane A).
- **Candidate** — a raid member eligible for / responding to an item.
- **Council** — members who vote (Plane A) and own the shared notes/marks (Plane B).
- **Session** — one open loot-voting cycle, identified by `sid`.
- **Mark** — a persistent council note attached to an item ("give next to X").
- **Plane A / B** — live ML-authoritative voting / persistent replicated council data.
